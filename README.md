VGG 16 CNN multi-label classification of pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal X-ray label datasets. In this article, we will discuss the implementation of the VGG 16 CNN architecture to classify chest X-ray images into three categories â€“ pneumonia, COVID-19, and normal.

Pneumonia and COVID-19 are two of the most prevalent respiratory illnesses in the world today, both of which can be diagnosed using chest X-ray images. This is where machine learning models come in to play, and in particular, convolutional neural networks (CNNs).

The VGG 16 architecture is a well-known deep learning model that has been used extensively in image classification tasks. It comprises 13 convolutional layers, 5 max-pooling layers, and 3 fully connected layers. The model has 138 million parameters, making it a very powerful tool for image classification tasks.

Our dataset consists of chest X-ray images of patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal cases. The images were collected from various sources and annotated by medical professionals to ensure the accuracy of the labels.

We trained the VGG 16 CNN model on this dataset, using a multi-label classification approach, which allowed us to classify each image into all three categories. We used the binary cross-entropy loss function and Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 to train the model.

We achieved an accuracy of 92% on the train set, which is an impressive result. The model was able to correctly classify the majority of the images into their respective categories, which could help medical professionals to make a quicker and more accurate diagnosis.

In conclusion, the VGG 16 CNN architecture is a powerful tool for multi-label classification of chest X-ray images. With an accuracy of 92%, this model could be a valuable aid for medical professionals in diagnosing respiratory illnesses. We hope that this article has been informative and helpful to those interested in this topic.
